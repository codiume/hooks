## 🦋 Changesets

We use the [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) library to manage versioning in this project. As part of your pull request (PR) submission, it is essential to include a corresponding changeset detailing the modifications made. Changesets help us keep track of version updates and ensure transparent communication regarding changes introduced to the codebase.

To include a changeset in your PR:

1. Create a changeset using the following command within your project directory:

```bash
pnpm changesets
```

2. Follow the prompts to describe the changes introduced in your PR. Ensure the changeset adheres to our contribution guidelines.

3. Commit the changeset file(s) along with your code changes.

Including changesets in your PR demonstrates transparency and facilitates smoother version management. PRs lacking corresponding changesets may be subject to additional review or may not be merged until changesets are provided.

For more information on using Changesets, refer to the official documentation.
